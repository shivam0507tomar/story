Ganges water on him and entrusted him with guarding the door.

While she was away,lord Shiva returned and was surprised to find a little boy standing at the entrance to his wifes chamber.
when he tried to enter, the boy blocked his path.

"who are you and why are you blocking my path?"demanded Lord Shiva.

"No one enters my mother's chamber",declared the boy boldly.

Taken aback,Lord Shiva replied, "Step away; I have the right to enter my wife's chamber."

But the young and courageous boy did not move but stood his ground.

he cut off the boy's head.

Goddess Parvati on returning from her bath saw her son lying dead and was overcome with grief. She was

nature with my anger.

seeing this lord Shiva sent his soldiers to fetch the head of the first beast that they saw. the men rushed and finally came 
upon an elephant. They quickly attached it onto the body of the slain boy and gave him life once again.

To further appease his grief-stricken wife he promised that her son would be worshipped first before all other Gods.
